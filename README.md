This project was made by Garrison Hinshaw for the Hacker U Milestone Project 1

This game is called Wicked Wizards. It is a side-scroller shooter game where you have to defeat enemies and dodge obstacles in order to score points. Lets see how far you can make it!!

All graphics are legally used through craftpix and other free image hosters provided by the course.

Knowledge of canvas and how to use it came from the HackerU Software Development Bootcamp, MDN, and a myriad of youtube videos most importantly Frank's Laboratory for really delving deep and going over the basics of how to use canvas and its different functions.

I hope you enjoy,

Garrison
